# Sensora_HomeAutomation
A simple Home automation prototype project using NodeMCU ESP8266 and Adafruit IO capabilities.</br>
In this project we have used :</br>
   -> NodeMCU ESP8266 - To connect and receice data from the server.</br>
   -> LDR sensor - To check light intensity of the current state in the room.</br>
   -> Adafruit IO - Which is acting as a Server and is also used to create a dashboard using which the lights can also be controlled by the user/customer.</br>
   -> LED lights or a relay which is connected to the actual light can be used as the Output source.
